# Machine Learning by Stanford University (Coursera)

This repository contains all the course programming assignments, quizzes, and lecture materials [Machine Learning by Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

<!-- ## Take Away

After completion, I gained an intermediate idea of some common machine learning algorithms and how they work. -->
